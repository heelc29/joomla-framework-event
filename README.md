The Joomla! **Event** package provides foundations to build event systems and an implementation supporting prioritized listeners.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1 or later

## Installation via Composer

Add `"joomla/event": "~3.0"` to the require block in your composer.json and then run `composer install`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"joomla/event": "~3.0"
	}
}
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the following from the command line:

```sh
composer require joomla/event "~3.0"
```

If you want to include the test sources and docs, use

```sh
composer require --prefer-source joomla/event "~3.0"
```
